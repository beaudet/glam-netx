# glam-netx
A repository of code, workflows, and documentation for cultural heritage customers of [NetX] (http://netx.net).

## Purpose

The core idea is to reduce duplication of efforts and share solutions to common issues.  Museums typically have the same set of use-cases.  Solutions can be quite different, and content in this repo is not an endorsement of best-practices or technology platforms.  It can, however, be useful to see how others have approached the same or similar problem.
  
> Note: The repo is a set of links to other documents, web pages, blogs, repos, etc.  The only modifications should be to README.md 

## How to Submit

You should use the same format as the first entry. Create a institution entry and then repo content below that.  There is no particular order.  [This](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/) covers the basics of formatting in a repo.
